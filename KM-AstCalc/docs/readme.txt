AstCalc helps you perform scientific calculations with particular attention to astronomical purposes. With AstCalc, you may quickly evaluate some intricate calculus you eventually need for prompt use. When looking for values of some physical or astronomical constants and performing some quick calculations with them, you can count on AstCalc, which you can get directly from here after freely downloading. AstCalc was fully designed in JavaScript. You may access and modify its code if you feel comfortable with this programming language under the condition it complies with the GNU-GPL, the GNU General Public License. AstCalc is designed to give you numeric results without having to write heavy programs, or when you are developing, you may perform some tests with its aid.
The calculation method is based on the RPN - Reversed Polish Notation, which the HP calculators introduced in the 1960s. Even if you are unfamiliar with it, with some exercises presented here, you will rapidly learn to work with it. Be sure that, in the end, you will find it very easy and even preferable to the usual notation that modern calculators apply.
